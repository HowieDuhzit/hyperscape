# Aethermoor: World Lore and Backstory

## The World of Aethermoor

Aethermoor is a vast continent suspended between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Void, held in place by six ancient Worldstones. The land is suffused with magical energy called "Luminance" that flows through invisible ley lines, pooling in certain locations and creating areas of wild magic.

## The Creation Myth

In the beginning, there was only the Void and the Primordial Light. When they collided, the explosion created the first beings: the Architects. These godlike entities shaped Aethermoor from the cosmic debris, each Architect contributing their essence:

- **Terranak** gave form to mountains and earth
- **Aquanis** filled the seas and rivers
- **Pyrrhon** kindled the first flames and forged the sun
- **Zephyra** breathed life into the winds
- **Umbriel** wove shadow and time
- **Luminara** infused all with magical essence

Before departing to higher planes, the Architects created the Worldstones to maintain the balance between order and chaos.

## The Three Ages

### The Age of Wonders (5000-3000 years ago)
The first mortal races emerged: the Primarchs (now extinct), who built impossible cities of crystal and light. They discovered how to harness Luminance directly, creating artifacts of immense power. Their hubris led to the "Great Sundering" when they attempted to ascend to godhood, shattering their civilization and scattering magical artifacts across the land.

### The Age of Kingdoms (3000-500 years ago)
From the ruins arose five great nations:

**The Celestial Empire of Lux Aeterna**
- Located in the floating islands of the Eastern Reaches
- Masters of Light magic and artifice
- Ruled by the Luminous Council, descendants of the Primarchs
- Their capital, Astralheim, orbits the continent on a massive floating citadel

**The Shadowmere Dominion**
- Deep beneath the surface in vast cavern networks
- Practitioners of Shadow magic and necromancy
- Governed by the Umbral Lords
- Their society values secrets and knowledge above all else

**The Verdant Throne**
- Forest kingdom in the Western Wildlands
- Nature magic and druidic traditions
- Led by the Eternal Oak, a sentient tree older than memory
- Allied with fey creatures and forest spirits

**The Forge Republics**
- Mountain strongholds in the Northern Peaks
- Masters of runic magic and metallurgy
- Democratic councils of master crafters
- Created the Warforged, living constructs of metal and magic

**The Tidecaller Confederation**
- Island nations and coastal cities
- Water and storm magic
- Loose alliance of merchant princes and pirate lords
- Control most maritime trade routes

### The Age of Fractures (500 years ago - present)
The discovery of "Voidshards" - fragments of pure anti-magic - triggered the "War of Nullification." Each kingdom sought to weaponize these shards, leading to magical dead zones and reality tears. The war ended in stalemate, with all nations weakened and the Worldstones beginning to crack.

## Current Conflicts

### The Worldstone Crisis
Three of the six Worldstones show signs of corruption. Strange phenomena occur near them:
- Time loops and temporal anomalies
- Creatures from other planes bleeding through
- Magic behaving unpredictably
- The appearance of "Null Zones" where magic ceases to function

### The Pretender's War
Multiple claimants to the ancient Primarch bloodline have emerged, each wielding artifacts and claiming the right to unite Aethermoor. Their conflicts devastate the borderlands.

### The Deepwood Plague
A mysterious blight spreads through the Western Wildlands, turning nature against itself. Corrupted treants and twisted fey terrorize settlements. The Verdant Throne grows silent.

### The Revenant Fleet
Ghost ships from the War of Nullification have begun appearing, crewed by undead seeking to finish their final battle. They attack indiscriminately, and their presence disrupts magical energies.

## Mysteries and Legends

### The Seventh Stone
Rumors speak of a hidden seventh Worldstone that could restore balance or destroy everything. Ancient texts provide contradictory clues to its location.

### The Primarch Vaults
Hidden caches of Primarch technology and knowledge. Each vault is protected by elaborate puzzles, guardians, and reality-bending defenses. Only twelve have been found; legends say there are 100.

### The Whispering Waste
A desert where the Great Sundering began. Travelers report hearing voices of the dead Primarchs offering power in exchange for service. None who accept are seen again.

### The Chronomancer's Tower
A tower that appears in different locations throughout history. Those who enter emerge changed, claiming to have lived entire lifetimes in other eras. Some return with knowledge of events yet to come.

### The Living Dungeon
Beneath the Shadowmere capital lies a dungeon that grows and changes. New rooms appear overnight, filled with treasures and horrors. Some theorize it's a living entity feeding on adventurers' fears and desires.
