For text and image generation, as well as image desciption, use gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini from OpenAI.

For 3D item generation, remeshing, retexturing, avatar creation and rigging, we are using meshy.ai

The API keys for these are available in the root project .env, so use dotenv to access environment variables

Current Anthropic models:
Claude Opus 4 claude-opus-4-20250514
Claude Sonnet 4	claude-sonnet-4-20250514

Current OpenAI models:
'gpt-4o'
'gpt-4o-mini'
'o1-2024-12-17'

Current OpenAI image models:
'gpt-image-1' // newer and better, more controllable but needs special API key access / KYC
'dall-e-3'
